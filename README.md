# Dataset-Condensation-for-Data-Privacy

There are a lot of black box models released by service providers like Amazon and Google which use
the customerâ€™s data for training. Even these black box models are vulnerable to privacy attacks and
it makes it crucial to make the black box models more private. In this work, we explore the use of
dataset condensation, which provides two-fold benefits, more efficiency in training, and also making
the data more private for free.
